Optical diffraction

narrowslit: Fraunhofer diffraction pattern plot for 3 slit widths. 
ntest: theta test for min and max points (narrowslit).  
ivw: Bessel function Airry diffraction pattern. 
besselfn: plots the J0 and J1 Matlab Bessel functions.
thetafromw: finds theta from the w values (max, min, J=0 points of J0(x=w)).
multitest: finds theta values for tall maxima (multi slit diffraction). 
ndiff: plots multi slit diffration (5 and 10) at 2 wavelengths.
fint: plots the Fresnel integrals.
cspiral: plots the Cornu spiral.
