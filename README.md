# Computational-physics
Computational physics code written at university

Split into 4 parts: general, non-linear dynamics, optical diffraction and quantum physics.

(Some code maybe subject to external copyright).

ex1p3: draws a circle of given radius.
ex1p4: double inegral of exp(-x^2/2)*sin(x^2+y) between limits.
ex1p5: plots a circular helix.
ex1p6: particle in a 3-D box wavefunction plot for the 2,1,1 quantum state.
ex1p7: simple non-linear pendulum plot.
ex1p8: 2-D projectile motion plot.
lpoly: plots Legendre polynomials.
meshgrid_eg: meshgrid example. 
myfun: function test.
planckfndiff: solves the value for planck function peak (after differentiation).
planckfnint: planck function integration.
sin2: plots sin(x)^2.
