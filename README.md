Computational physics code written at university

Split into 4 parts: general, non-linear dynamics, optical diffraction and quantum physics.

(Some code maybe subject to external copyright).

general
ex1p3: draws circle of given radius.
ex1p4: double inegral of exp(-x^2/2)*sin(x^2+y) between limits.
ex1p5: plots circular helix.
ex1p6: particle in a 3-D box wavefunction plot for the 2,1,1 quantum state.
ex1p7: simple non-linear pendulum plot.
ex1p8: 2-D projectile motion plot.


non lin
ex2p1: plots simple non-linear damped pendulum.
ex2p2: calculates the inital energy of a damped non-linear pendulum.
ex2p4: plots various inverted pendulums configurations. 
ex2p5: plots the Rayleigh's equation.
ex2p7: plots the Van der Pol equation for several configurations.
ex2p8: plots entrainment.
ex2p8p2: plots quasiperodicty.


optical
ivw: Bessel fuction Airry diffraction pattern. 
besselfn: plots the J0 and J1 Matlab Bessel functions.
fint: plots the Fresnel integrals.
cspiral: plots the Cornu spiral.
f2: Fresnel diffraction by a straight edge and a long narrow slit.


quantun
avrv: calculates the mean value of the radial probablity of the electron wavefunciton in a hydrogen atom with 4 different sets of quantum numbers.
energylv: electron energy levels in a hydrogen atom.
ev: finds the resonance energy values for the electrons.
