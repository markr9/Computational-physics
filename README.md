# Computational-physics
Computational physics code written at university

Split into 4 parts: general, non-linear dynamics, optical diffraction and quantum physics.

(Some code maybe subject to external copyright).

general

non lin
e2p2: calculates the inital energy of a damped non-linear pendulum.

optical
besselfn: plots the J0 and J1 Matlab Bessel functions.
cspiral: plots the Cornu spiral.


quantun
avrv: calculates the mean value of the radial probablity of the electron wavefunciton in a hydrogen atom with 4 different sets of quantum numbers.
energylv: electron energy levels in a hydrogen atom.
ev: finds the resonance energy values for the electrons.
