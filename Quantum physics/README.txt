Quantum physics

tun: plots the transmittance probablity of an electron at different energies through a potential barrier. 
ev: finds the transmission coefficient of an electron for a given energy. (for potential barrier). 
res: finds the resonance energy values for the electrons (for potentail barrier).
wavefuns: plots the radial wavefunction and probability values of a hydrogen atom for various n and l values. 
avrv: calculates the mean value of the radial probablity of the electron wavefunciton in a hydrogen atom with 4 different sets of quantum numbers.
Yfn: plots the spherical harmonic for l=2, m=0. 
energylv: electron energy levels in a hydrogen atom.
veff: plots the effective potential of a hydrogen atom with different 'l' values. 
stark_effect: plots the stark effect for a hydrogen atom at n=2.
